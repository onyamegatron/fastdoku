# fastdoku
Minimal and fast way to play sudoku
No mouse needed

## Status
* Beginning Stage

## Idea
* Use Dosoku API to generate sudoku board.
* Use Numpad with combination of keys with move around board, make pencil marking, enter numbers
* No errors or warnings (Subject to change)

## Further
* Implement custom algorithm for generating valid sudoku boards rather than outsourcing sudoku puzzles.
* ~~Develop for mobile~~ This is made for using a numpad, too bad if you don't have a numpad

## Reason for project
I like sudoku, I want to go back to basics and practice vanillaJS.
